    <article id="about">
        <p>We are crazy cat people! My name is Kyle, and I founded <strong>Kitty C4</strong> in the winter of 2020 as a database project for my Intro to Microsoft Access class. This website is following up a year later as the public debut of that ficitonal company. My main motivation was my love for my wife and our shared love for our adult kitten, Magnolia "Memow" Richter. We know that not everybody has the time, patience, or general ability to take care of their cats, so we decided to offer a ficitonal service to help people take care of their cats - in all the ways that the little furballs deserve!</p> 
        <p>We hope that you can find a use for our services, even if that use is just a little smile while bowsing this website. We don't have ads yet, <!--because I don't know how to program those--> but that doesn't mean that we get nothing out of sharing this business! Have a great day, and go pet a cat!</p>
